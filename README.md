# ORMIR templates

In this repository you will find the [ORMIR](https://www.ormir.org/) templates for:  
- [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ORMIRcommunity/templates/blob/main/ORMIR_nb_template.ipynb)
- [readme.md](https://github.com/ORMIRcommunity/templates/blob/main/ORMIR_readme_template.md) file for a GitHub repository
- [Folder and file structure for a computational project](https://github.com/ORMIRcommunity/templates/tree/main/computational_project) 

## Why templates? 
These templates are meant to facilitate MSK imaging researchers in working in an open and reproducible way. Just as you download a manuscript template and complete it when writing a paper, here you can download these templates and adapt them to the needs of your code, data, and narratives.
