- *Add 1-2 lines description of the package* 
- *Add a table of content if relevant (see how to create a TOC in markdown/html [here -link_to_nb_template_to_be_added](link_to_notebook_template))*

---
## Installation

- *Specify how to install your package, such as:*

  > Install [package_name] by pasting the following line in a terminal:   
  > `pip install package_name`

- *If you install from Anaconda*:
   > Install [package_name] by pasting the following line in a terminal:   
   > `conda install package_name`

### Development installation 
- *If you want to contribute, start by cloning the repository*:     
    > `!git clone https://github.com/[account_name]/[package_name].git`  
- *Navigate to repo folder*:
    > `%cd [package_name]`  
    
- *Install using pip*:
    > `!pip install .`

## Usage 

- *A Python package can usually be imported in Python code and/or run from a command line as a script.*
- *If you package is imported in Python code, add something like:*  

  > To use [package_name] in your code, import it as:  
  > `import package_name`
- *If you package can be run from command line, add something like:*   
  
  > To run [package_name] from terminal, type:   
  >`package_name parameter1 parameter2`

## User guide / Tutorials

- *Please, take particular care of documentation and examples, so that other researchers can easily use your code* 

- Use cases
  - *Directly here in the readme file (see example [here](https://github.com/gianthk/ciclope))*  
  - *As links to notebooks (see example [here_tbd]()). In this case, add links to [binder](https://mybinder.org/) whenever possible (learn how to link your GitHub repository to Binder, by reading this [documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) or watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owSGVOov9pQ))*
  - *As a link to a separate website (see example [here_tbd]())* 
  - *As a combination of the above*
