- `ormir_mids`: where you can save the output of [ORMIR-MIDS](https://ormir-mids.github.io/), used to re-structure the raw data according to the ORMIR-MIDS standard
- `results`: where you can save the outputs of the computational workflows, i.e., the tables containing aggregative statistics or morphometric analysis
